-- Spiral Three --

Objectives:
 - Finalize API and confirm expected functionality with the front end group and client
 - Research and implement a MySQL DB stress testing strategy and document the results
 - Research and implement a mitigation strategy for SQL injection attacks
 - Refactor code to be more concise in the updated environment
 - Create updated class diagrams
 - Create a dependency chart to show inter-file dependency within the project
 - Consider creating a cache for added functionality and ease of access
 - Add tests for the new functionality and API calls

Risks:
 - Stress testing may require extensive research for the appropriate tool
 - A successful caching strategy must be realized carefully. It is possible to create a very bad strategy that decreases effectiveness of the API
 - Implementation depends on strong communication with the front end group and the client

Plan for next spiral: This is expected to be the last major spiral
