admin portal tool project for cs4500

I'll go over the proper usage in detail

./main.py [port] [host] [db_port] [user] [pw] [db]

port: the port you want the server to run on
host: the host of the MySQL DB
db_port: the port to use for connecting to the MySQL DB. if the DB is local, this argument is still required, but will not be used
user: the username for MySQL DB access
pw: the plaintext password for the MySQL DB user
db: the name of the MySQL database that the server will hook to

example: "./main.py 10003 localhost 3306 user password my_mysql_database_name

After running this command, the server will be listening on the provided port. You can connect to it by sending a get request to that port. The path of the get request should be the name of the table that you want to do a lookup on. The server will then respond with a JSON serialized data representation of the table or the empty string if the table was not found in the DB.

Examples of how this works can be found in the "tests.sh" file, which is an executable shell script that runs tests on a known DB with expected responses.

Usage for this test script:
./test.sh

All source code is extensively documented, so nothing should be unclear.
